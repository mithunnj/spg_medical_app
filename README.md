# SPG Medical Portal - Montreal Children's Hospital

A secure, HIPAA-compliant web application for coordinating patient discharge from the Pediatric ICU (PICU) to outbound family clinics.

## üè• Project Overview

This application facilitates secure communication between:
- **Hospital Doctors (PICU)**: Input patient discharge information and select outbound clinics
- **Clinic Doctors**: Review and approve/deny patient requests based on availability
- **Parents/Guardians**: View status updates and communication from healthcare providers

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Frontend & Backend
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with role-based access control

### Database & Storage
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Vercel Postgres for production)
- **ORM**: Prisma
- **File Storage**: Vercel Blob (HIPAA-compliant)
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM for patient data

### Deployment
- **Platform**: Vercel
- **Environment**: Production-ready with HIPAA compliance

## üîê Security & Compliance

### HIPAA Compliance Features
- ‚úÖ End-to-end encryption for patient data
- ‚úÖ Secure authentication with medical license verification
- ‚úÖ Audit logging (planned)
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control
- ‚úÖ Session management with 8-hour timeout
- ‚úÖ No indexing of medical data (`robots: noindex, nofollow`)

### Data Encryption
Patient personal information is encrypted before storage:
- Names, DOB, health card numbers
- Addresses and contact information
- Emergency contact details

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### User Roles
1. **HOSPITAL_DOCTOR**: PICU doctors creating discharge requests
2. **CLINIC_DOCTOR**: Outbound clinic doctors reviewing requests
3. **PARENT**: Patient guardians viewing updates
4. **ADMIN**: System administrators

### Database Schema
- **Users**: Healthcare professionals and parents
- **Hospitals**: PICU and other hospital facilities
- **Clinics**: Outbound family doctor clinics
- **Patients**: Encrypted patient records
- **DischargeRequests**: Patient discharge coordination
- **PatientFiles**: Secure file attachments

## üöÄ Development Setup

### üìù Planned Features (Feature Branches)
1. **Patient Information System** - Forms for PICU doctors to input patient data
2. **File Management** - Secure upload/download of patient files
3. **Clinic Selection** - Interface for selecting and contacting outbound clinics
4. **Request Management** - Clinic portal for reviewing and responding to requests
5. **Parent Portal** - Status updates and communication for families
6. **Security & Compliance** - Additional HIPAA features and audit logging

## üåü Feature Branch Workflow

Each major feature will be developed in separate branches:

```bash
# Example workflow
git checkout -b feature/patient-input-system
# Develop feature
git commit -m "Add patient input forms"
git push origin feature/patient-input-system
# Create PR to main
```

### Planned Feature Branches
- `feature/patient-input-system`
- `feature/file-management`
- `feature/clinic-selection`
- `feature/clinic-portal`
- `feature/parent-portal`
- `feature/security-compliance`
